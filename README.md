# TuberculosisDetectionWithImageProcessing
This is a Matlab project which is used to detect Tuberculosis(TB) in a patient based on Chest X-rays. A ML model is trained with a lot of X-ray images of normal individuals and TB affected individuals, and the trained model is used to predict a new X-ray of a patient to identify TB.
